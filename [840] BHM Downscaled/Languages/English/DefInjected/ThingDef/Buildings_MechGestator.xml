	<CN_MechGestator.description>A cabin filled with extraordinary micro-mechanical fluids used to manufacture or revive the mechanical family, and connected with several life-support pipelines for transporting materials and nutrients. Unlike standard mechanical incubators, this one has been further modified and optimized. A machine incubator of this scale can only be used to manufacture CN machines. \n\nDue to the harsh chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Therefore, the colonists must transport the toxic pollutants they produce from time to time and place them properly.</CN_MechGestator.description>
